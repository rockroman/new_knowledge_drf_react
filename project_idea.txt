Im about to start creating a project that will be a django rest API and react frontend and Im sketching the entity relat. diagram for models.
so flow of the app should be like this:
1. two types of users(MENTOR AND STUDENT) -here I wouldnt like to go with custom user modelif its nor neccessery since I never worked with it but you can provide suggestion later.
so after logging in user will have to choose his role(or type of user)


2. based on type of user there would be different functionality: so MENTOR user will have functionality to create a lesson within few LEARNING_CATEGORIES,
ALL CRUD functionality included, there would be different fields in lesson model,


3. each user would have a Profile, so (another model) and inbox(another model) 


4. inbox would work on functionality is the user FOLLOWED so (another model) and if user is following another user they can communicate through a inbox messages if not they cant


5. each user would have a functionality to like and comment lesson  but only a lesson of category they have selected in their profile

6. only mentors would have functionality to create a lesson(only in category they have in their profile also) , so students can only view it comment it and communicate with mentor if they are following him
